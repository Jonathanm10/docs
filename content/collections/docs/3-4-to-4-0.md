## Overview

First read through this guide to see if there's anything that you might need to adjust. When upgrading, Statamic may automate some things for you. They'll be noted below.

In your `composer.json`, change the `statamic/cms` requirement:

```json
"statamic/cms": "3.4.*" // [tl!--]
"statamic/cms": "^4.0" // [tl!++]
```

Then run:

``` shell
composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies
```

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8 or Laravel < 9.**

- The minimum version of PHP is now 8.0.
- The minimum version of Laravel is now 9.


### AMP has been removed
**Affects apps using the AMP feature.**

AMP is considered a dead project, and no longer provides SEO benefits, so the entire AMP feature has been removed.

## Medium impact changes

### Route namespaces have been removed
**Affects apps or addons using PHP-based routes.**

When using the following various methods of adding custom routes, previously Statamic would assume a namespace. In 4.0, the namespace is removed.

Standard Laravel routes that you've added to your app routes files are not affected.

- `Statamic::pushCpRoutes()`
- `Statamic::pushWebRoutes()`
- `Statamic::pushActionRoutes()`
- Addon route files
- Addon service provider `$this->registerCpRoutes()`
- Addon service provider `$this->registerWebRoutes()`
- Addon service provider `$this->registerActionRoutes()`

For example, in an addon's `cp.php` routes file:

```php
Route::get('example', 'ExampleController@foo');
// v3 = Your\Addon\Http\Controllers\ExampleController@foo
// v4 = ExampleController@foo
```

In an addon, if you _want_ a namespace, you can add one with a property:

```php
protected $routeNamespace = 'Your\Addon\Http\Controllers';
```

However, we recommend using the class reference syntax:

```php
use Your\Addon\Http\Controllers\ExampleController;

Route::get('example', [ExampleController::class, 'foo']);
```


### Str::replace arguments changed
**Affects apps or addons using `Statamic\Support\Str::replace()`.**

The `Statamic\Support\Str::replace()` method changed the argument order. The `$subject` argument moved from first to last.

```php
Str::replace($subject, $search, $replace); // [tl! --]
Str::replace($search, $replace, $subject); // [tl! ++]
```

### Tailwind 3
**Affects apps or addons with custom CP components.**

The Control Panel has been upgraded from Tailwind 1 to 3. The sizing scale has been adjusted. Custom components may render unexpectedly and may need to have classes renamed.

## Low impact changes

### jQuery removed
**Affects apps or addons with custom CP components using jQuery.**
jQuery and jQuery UI were seldom used, and have been removed to lower the CP's overhead. We suggest replacing with Vue or Alpine equivalents.

### vue-reactive-provide removed
**Affects custom CP Vue components using the `reactiveProvide` property.**

The `vue-reactive-provide` package was removed. We suggest using providing an observed object.

```js
reactiveProvide: { // [tl! --:start]
    name: 'foo',
    include: ['alfa', 'bravo']
} // [tl! --:end]
provide: { // [tl! ++:start]
    foo: this.foo
},
data() {
    foo: this.makeProvidedFoo();
},
methods: {
    makeProvidedFoo() {
        const foo = {};
        Object.defineProperties(grid, {
            alfa: { get: () => this.alfa },
            bravo: { get: () => this.bravo },
        });
        return foo;
    }
} // [tl! ++:end]
```

### Flysystem v1 support dropped
**Affects apps or addons explicitly using Flysystem v1 code.**

Support for `league/flysystem` v1 has been removed. Only v3 is supported.

### CommonMark v1 support dropped
**Affects apps or addons with custom CommonMark v1 extensions.**

Support for `league/commonmark` v1 has been removed. Only v2 is supported.

### Typography CSS styling
**Affects apps or addons with custom CP components using the `clean-content` CSS class.**

The custom `.clean-content` css class in the Control Panel has been replaced by `.prose` from Tailwind's typography plugin.

### FontAwesome and Entypo fonts have been removed
**Affects apps or addons with custom CP components using these fonts.**

Both icon fonts have been removed, and replaced with Streamline SVG icons.
